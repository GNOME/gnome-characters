- Clicking "Copy Character" is adding it to Favorites, which shouldn't happen



### "Copy Character" Adding to Favorites
The "Copy Character" action should not add the character to favorites. This might be happening due to an incorrect connection or logic in the event handling. Ensure that the "copy" action is only bound to copying functionality and does not trigger adding to favorites. Here's how you can adjust the connection:

```javascript:src/window.js
260|        dialog.connect('character-copied', (_widget, char) => {
261|            this.addToRecent(char);
262|            // Remove any calls to addToFavorites here
263|        });
```
